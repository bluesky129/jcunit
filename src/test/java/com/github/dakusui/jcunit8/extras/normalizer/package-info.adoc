This packages holds classes for the "factor space normalization" mechanism.

== Factor Space Normalization Mechanism

Factor Space Normalization Mechanism provides a way to "abstract" a given factor space.
With this capability, JCUnit can support external Combinatorial Interaction Testing(CIT) tools, such as ACTS and PICT.
Not only that, the mechanism to "store" generated covering arrays to reuse them are relying on this.

It creates an object called ```FactorSpaceSpec```, which has information to describe characteristics of the given factor space but omitting concrete aspects.

== Architecture

Following diagram illustrates the overall architecture of this mechanism.

----

An object ```FactorSpaceSpec``` holds information to construct a factor space

=== Internal Representation


== Limitation

* Signature of a factor space that has constraints.


== Terminology

FactorSpace:: Factor Space consists of factors and constraints among them.
