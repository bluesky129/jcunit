This packages holds classes for the "Abstractive Generator" mechanism.

== Abstractive Generator

Factor Space Normalization Mechanism provides a way to "abstract" a given factor space.
With this capability, JCUnit can support external Combinatorial Interaction Testing(CIT) tools, such as ACTS and PICT.
Not only that, the mechanism to "store" generated covering arrays to reuse them are relying on this.

It creates an object called ```FactorSpaceSpec```, which has information to describe characteristics of the given factor space but omitting concrete aspects.

== Design

Following diagram xref:Pipeline[] illustrates the overall architecture of this mechanism.

=== Abstractive Generator

*Abstractuve Generator* component reads a raw factor space, which is built by a user and contains concrete information about test cases, such as names of factors and actual values of each levels of theirs and generates a test suite as other generators.
However, it first generates an intermediate entity called *Normalized Factor Space*, which consists of a *FactorSpaceSpec* and *Denormalizer* and let another module *Generation Engine* generate an abstract test suite.

(t.b.d.)

==== Factor Space Normalizer

Factor Space normalizer is a component that directly reads an input, "raw" factor space and it generates a normalized factor space by extracting abstract characteristics of it while generating another entity "denormalizer".

(t.b.d)



===== Normalized Factor Space

(t.b.d.)

===== Factor Space Spec

A **Factor Space Spec** is an entity that holds mathematical characteristics of the Raw Factor Space.

Signature
(t.b.d.)

===== Denormalizer and TestSuiteWrapper

Denormalizer has a capability of converting a test case in an **Abstract Test Suite**

(t.b.d.)

==== Generation Engine

*Cacher* Generator and *Acts* support by JCunit are examples of such Generation Engines.

(t.b.d.)

===== Abstract Test Suite (Covering Array)

(t.b.d.)

=== Persistence



== Limitation

* Signature of a factor space that has constraints.
* Negative Test generation.
* Normalizability. Types and constraints. (int, bool, enum)


== Terminology

FactorSpace:: Factor Space consists of factors and constraints among them.
